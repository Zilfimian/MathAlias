Welcome to MathAlias, the mathematical version of the popular game Alias. In this game, players compete in teams, taking turns describing various mathematical terms without using the actual term itself. The goal is to help teammates guess the word within a time limit, earning points for correct answers. Be prepared for an exciting and educational challenge!

## Game Rules
- Players form teams and take turns describing mathematical terms without using the actual term.
- The describer can use any kind of explanation or clue, including equations, properties, related concepts, or historical contexts, but cannot use the term itself.
- Teams earn points for correct guesses within the time limit, and lose points for incorrect guesses or passing.
- Incorrect guesses or passing within the time limit result in a point deduction or loss of turn.

## Options (Paid version):
 
- Timer settings for each round.
- Adjustable difficulty levels to cater to players of different mathematical proficiency.
- Inclusion of power-ups or hints for challenging terms.
- Ability to create custom word lists or categories, allowing players to focus on specific areas of mathematics.
- Incorporate multiplayer modes, enabling users to compete with friends or players worldwide.
- Integration with social media platforms for sharing scores or inviting friends to play.
- Daily challenges or puzzles to keep players engaged and motivated.
