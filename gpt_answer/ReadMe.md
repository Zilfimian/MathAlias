# MathAlias Game Word Database

This repository serves as the home for the MathAlias Game Word Database, created using the powerful capabilities of Chatbot GPT-3.5. The repository contains an Excel file ('Objects.xlsx') that compiles a comprehensive list of mathematical terms and names. 

## How it Works
The code in this repository utilizes the R programming language and various libraries such as stringr and dplyr for data manipulation and management. The 'Translation.R' script facilitates the translation of extracted terms to different languages, enriching the database's multilingual capabilities. The OpenAI API, specifically the "text-davinci-003" model, plays a pivotal role in generating a comprehensive list of mathematical terms and names.

## Future Updates
This repository will undergo periodic updates, incorporating additional features and functionalities to enrich the database further. The ultimate goal is to create a versatile and comprehensive resource for individuals interested in mathematics and related fields.

Feel free to contribute to this repository by expanding the database or implementing new functionalities. Your contributions are highly appreciated and will contribute to the growth and enrichment of the MathAlias Game Word Database.
